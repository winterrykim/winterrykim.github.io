Teaching and educational content creation have always been one of my passion. My early involvement in computer science began at the intersection of education and technology — EdTech.

Having lived, studied, and worked across three different countries, I’ve experienced diverse educational systems and cultures. This global perspective has inspired my work on educational technologies aimed at improving learning outcomes.

### Projects and Experience

- **Theta One (ML Engineer)**  
  Worked on an English AI Tutor. I fine-tuned speech-to-text (STT) models to better understand Korean-accented English, helping improve accessibility for non-native speakers. 

- **Debate-Based EdTech Prototype**  
  Designed a hyper-personalized English debate learning tool to promote critical thinking and language acquisition. Though I stopped working on this project, I led the entire National R&D $458.7k grant project proposal (to make sure I don't exaggerate here - it is a proposal) / IR Pitch / technical system design / financial statements for a Debate EdTech product end to end. Made to top 9 final selection out of 90 companies, giving IR pitch to government investors. 

- **LLM for CS Education @ ACE Lab, UC Berkeley**  
  Contributed to a project leveraging large language models to support instruction in CS61A, Berkeley’s largest introductory computer science course.

- **AI4 Science Educational Blog (Both in Eng/Kor) **  
  I write educational content aimed at bridging the gap between CS and biology—teaching biology to computer scientists, and computing to life scientists.

### Teaching Experience

- **Summer 2021** – Academic Intern, *Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science*, UC Berkeley  
- **Spring 2025** – Course Staff (TA), *Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science*, UC Berkeley
