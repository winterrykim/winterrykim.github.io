Hi! I'm **Terry (Taehan) Kim**, a Computer Science student at UC Berkeley working at the intersection of **machine learning and biology**. I'm passionate about building useful, interpretable tools that are accessible and trustworthy to both biologists and computer scientists.

During undergrad, I‚Äôve done my best to explore a wide range of problems in computational biology ‚Äî from small molecule generative design to protein structure prediction, RNA secondary structure learning, and single-cell modeling with probabilistic inference. I began with traditional ML tasks and gradually pushed myself toward projects that required deeper integration with biological domain knowledge, bridging the gap between engineering and life sciences.

I also love building educational content to make these ideas more accessible ‚Äî you can find it on [AI4Science Blog](http://tinyurl.com/3mctvcap).
